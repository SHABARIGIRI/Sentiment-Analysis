All toiletries and tea\u002Fcoffee materials are replenished each day without asking for them! The hotel has an in-house restaurant with room service and has all kinds of food (only veg) in its menu. Again, the catering staff are extremely well behaved and polite. A plus point of this hotel is its location: just behind the hotel there are multiple dhabas and an icecream shop serving ICEDISH...(shud try atleast once for a change from regular icecreams); McD and pizzahut are nearby, as are 4 ATMs. The hotel is close to (within walking distance) several good hospitals and medicine shops, which came to be very useful when I had a medical emergency during my stay.

On the day we were leaving, we had some time to kill and decided to go to Vapi to see a movie.\n\nThis was one of those \""Big Cinemas\"" multiplex. As we left Daman for Vapi it started raining and ten minutes in to the drive it was raining cats and dogs. Guess what? The management of this theatre cancelled the show because there were not enough patrons!!! The flimsy excuse given was that there was no electricity and that the generator had konked out. Of all the lame excuses this was the lamest! They made us wait for about forty five minutes, saying that they were waiting for the restoration of the electricity, whereas they were in fact waiting for some more movie goers to cover their costs. Finally they told us that there would be no show as starting a show this late would impact the next show!\n\nAnyway, by this time it was about two in the afternoon and we were hungry and started looking for a decent restaurant to have lunch at. On asking a shopkeeper if there were any good restaurants in the vicinity we were told to try Fortune Park Galaxy which also had a restaurant by the name of Orchid.\n\nThus was like God-send. In the middle of nowhere this starred property. With this quaint restaurant. A hotel nestling in a commercial area in the middle of all these shops. We had their buffet lunch and were mighty happy. Reasonably priced Rupees twelve hundred for the two of us (plus taxes) it was more than worth while. There was a cricket match going on and the management was more than happy to let us sit and watch the match, till our taxi arrived which was scheduled to arrive according to our original program of watching the movie first and then having lunch.\n\nIt is nice that the Fortune chain of hotels, which is part of the ITC group has these kind of properties in towns such as Vapi.

Although the room is a bit constrained on the space, it is very well furnished and has ample lighting. The washroom is spacious and comfortable. The TV has cable tv and the room also has a kettle for tea. I just wish the working table was a little bigger. It was too small to comfortably work on a laptop so i ended up working on my bed. The bed is comfortable though.\nFood: Probably the best thing about this hotel. The breakfast buffet at Orchid was quite nice with a very wide variety of selection on offer. It has south indian, north indian, veg, non-veg..enough to keep you happy. The quality on offer is also top-notch. The dinner buffet is similar story. Quite awesome food. We were never disappointed.\nStaff: the staff came across as very very courteous and polite. One gentleman in the restaurant kept insisting that we try out more stuff. Very well trained staff, I must commend the management for this.\nAmenities: The hotel also has an adjoining fitness centre. It has adequate equipment and quite useful. The lift in the hotel is from another era, it served us well but they should think of modernising it. One disappointment though: we wanted to use a small meeting room where  we could meet and discuss but no such room was available.\nLocation: Bang in the middle of a big market. It has some good eating options around as well.\nOverall, loved the stay at Fortune. Barring couple of minor issues, it was a lovely experience.",5,positive

Later we opted for a buffet dinner which was again pretty cheap enough (of course with limited varieties). The room service was excellent always on their toes. Most of their staff is from North eastern states of the country mainly Assam, Tripura, Manipur and few from Kolkata as well. Overall a gentle experience.

The only drawback, if it can be called that, is that as u get close to the place, there are no signboards indicating where the exact place is and u need to keep looking to locate it. It is bang opposite the Damanganga Resort on the left, as u come from Mumbai.\nWe reached there around 1 p.m. and were immediately checked in with a welcome drink into an excellent room. The Executive room is really very spacious and can comfortably accommodate 2 double beds (they have thoughtfully kept a sofa-cum bed which can be converted into a comfortable double bed). And even with this arrangement, the room doesn\u2019t look crowded as u would expect it in most places.\nThe resort is really superbly set-up with large areas of plants, trees and lawns. You rarely get to see such greenery anywhere in Mumbai. The overall structure is also very nicely built with accommodation to one side and the rest of the landscape on the other.\nThe best part of the trip was really the food. We stayed there for 3 nights and honestly, in all the meals we had over this period, there was not one instance where we had a reason to complain. You get the food included in the package, if u so choose. And believe me, it is more than worth it. The quality and spread of the buffet is really excellent, with veg. as well as non-veg. dishes well balanced along with the desert. And the pleasure is really doubled with the excellent ambience and the service provided. There is always someone attending to you for anything u need. \nThey have about 3 restaurants, one of which was closed for some reason. The breakfast and evening tea and snacks are in 1 semi-open restaurant amid the greenery, while lunch and dinner are in the other a\u002Fc facility.\nThe other attraction of the resort is its swimming pool. Though it is nothing to gush about being a maximum of 5 ft. deep, it is very well maintained and serves as a good place to dip and relax especially in the hot weather.

It completes the overall classy feel about the place \u2013 may be using a variety of adjectives, but the place deserves it.\n\nPlaces to see \u2013 There are parks, gardens, temples that you may pick and visit based on your preferences. We did the Vanganga lake garden, the deer park & the Bindrabin temple. And if you prefer, you could just be put up at this place & use the time to unwind royally!\n\nFor us, it definitely should have been a longer stay, but yes, we have added a favourite, drive-down destination to our list!

Being a small resort, one is assured of personalized and efficient service, thanks to Jitu (the Manager of the property) and his staff. A special mention of Chandan Das, our Man Friday for the entire duration of our stay. The food reminds one of mom's cooking and, although the menu is fixed, the chef and the staff are more than willing to pamper your food preferences. The entrance at the gate to Forest Village needs to be improved and there should be better lighting within the property. Prefer the Talasari route to the resort, instead of the rough road that Google Maps may suggest. During our stay, we visited Dudhani Jetty for a shikara ride (the drive to Dudhani Jetty is truly a pleasure on smooth, well-made roads), the Deer Park at Satmaliya Wildlife Sanctuary, Butterfly Park and Tribal Museum.",5,positive

The ride wasn\u2019t very bumpy, the weather pleasant and traffic minimal. Recommend this route rather than the one via Dhundalwadi even though its longer by about 8kms. \n\nForest Village is located away from the main town closer to nature and away from the noise and bustle of the not so green environs of Khanvel. The property comprises of six immaculate and identical cottages with three facing the road and three facing the forest. The white exterior paint on them stands out in the lush green surrounding\u2019s. The entrance to the cottage opens into a common sitting area giving access to a room each on either side. The rear of the sitting area opens out into the common verandah. The common sitting area of the cottage occupied by us also included a refrigerator. \n\nThe rooms are reasonably large and clean providing all the basic comforts. About 40 % of the room walls comprise floor to ceiling sliding windows flooding the interiors with natural light and also providing a visual display of the world outside. The furniture is a blend of antique and modern design. Was impressed with the antique looks of the ceiling fan. The promoters have been quite liberal with the number of light fitting\u2019s in the room and bathroom. The bathroom is pretty large and includes a huge tub and a separate sky-lit shower enclosure. The most striking feature of the bathroom are the sliding windows on a portion of one of the walls. The upper half of these windows are fitted with transparent glass and the lower half with opaque glass. The transparent glass gives a view of the outside surrounding\u2019s and a feeling of having a shower in the open. The opaque glass takes care of privacy. The well placed artificial bamboo plants in the shower enclosure compliment the bathroom d\u00E9cor.\n\nThe staff is courteous and helpful. However, what the hotel clearly lacks is room service. Room Service is not available even for morning bed tea. To add to the disappointment there is no provision of tea making facility in the room. Also the hotel does not have an a-la-carte menu. You have to settle for the fixed buffet meals\u002Fhi-tea\u002Fbreakfast. Could not try out the meals but the hi-tea and breakfast was good and came with home-made flavor. The arrangements for hi-tea are outdoors and this place may get crowded if the room occupancy is high. We had to stand and have our tea, along with some other guests. Those who had finished, continued to occupy the table chit- chatting. \n\nThe property by itself is appealing and if one is looking for a quiet and restful holiday, Forest Village will take care of that.",4,positive

There was only 1 meal we had outside the villa and didn't like that. Menu had soup, nice soft chapatis, 3 curries, daal , rice, salad and pickle. Breakfast included 2 items + bread\u002Fbutter\u002Fjam and tea\u002Fcoffee and a fruit. Curd was unavailable but that's a small thing compared to the simple and homely taste of food. Please eat in the villa if you like simple food\n4. The staff were nice and courteous. They kept the premises very clean. They were a bit laid back though. We ordered twice for tea in room. First time it didn't come for an hour and we cancelled it. Second time it came after 45 mins and a reminder after 25 mins. Otherwise they were good people as such.\n5. The place has a play area for kids and a swimming pool for leisure as such. You can use the lawn for playing games. The living area between the 2 rooms can be used for indoor games like carom\u002Fcards. We didn't have these in our room but we saw them in the villa and probably would have been available on request.\n6. Now the critical part. Our bad luck, there was a major power cut that lasted for 24 hours the day we checked in. They did have inverter back up on which worked 2 lights, a fan and 2 bathroom lights which worked till midnight around 1AM post which, we did not have any electricity till afternoon 2.30 PM. What we lost due to this is usage of AC, geyser, TV, Mobile chargers, wifi access etc. Even after the power was restored, there was continuous fluctuation next evening and finally again power was out all night from 3AM but the backup Fan worked till next day 8.15AM when power was restored. Unfortunately we had to check out same day and did not get to use these facilities for which we paid. The staff was not able to respond well to this crisis. From what we got to know, the staff was told not to let the customers know even though they were aware of this power outage but we are not sure of this. 2 families left the villa a day earlier due to frustration and we were also to leave but as the power was back at 2.30PM, we decided to continue the stay. We asked management for a reasonable refund but they were not ready for the same. They had agreed for refund if we checked out a day prior but were not in agreement to provide any amount of refund when we stated that we couldn't use the facilities like TV, AC, geyser, mobile charging for around 30 hours in our 48 hour stay. The reason cited is the power issue has not happened in history and that they would provide us better pricing next visit. This was very unfair and we felt kind of cheated. We were frustrated as we were the only ones who decided to continue the stay, so we decided to not pay for the extra lunch\u002Ftea we had on 24th and did not additionally tip the staff who otherwise deserved it.\n7. Since the overall stay was good, I don't want to poorly rate the place based on this one episode as it was really good otherwise. \n8. Our only advice would be that if you are visiting this place in rains, be prepared for power issues as they only have inverter backup and not generator. I guess winter would have been a much better experience. We would certainly plan this some winter with in a bigger group again.",4,positive

Initially I was hesitant regarding the stay at any hotel cause I was worried about the food for my child since we have only given her home made soft food. However I must admit that their hospitality impressed me as a monther since the staff were so friendly with my baby and for the fact that they even arranged the type of baby food which i needed without any hesitation or objection. Also the room service was prompt, we didnt have to remind them twice for the orders given to them. Breakfast lunch and dinner was equally superb, many varieties in the veg section. i hope they increase the variety in the non veg section. Rooms are quite spacious, the balcony is wide with a good view wherein one can sit and just gaze over the swimming pool and further on the mango orchards. There is also a small play area for kids with different trypes of games wherein kids can have fun. We would love visiting Pluz Resort again knowing that my baby will be well taken car of.

Unlike some of the reviews below, my experience in this resort was awful. \n\nWe had booked 4 rooms during Diwali weekend after paying Rs. 8,000\u002F- per room per night. My sincere advice is not to judge this place by its website which is very impressive however nowhere close to reality. Few of the over-hype facilities are:-\n1. This resort \u2018claims\u2019 to offer wi-fi, however it\u2019s available only in the reception area which is of no use. \n2. For a resort which is just over a year old, indoor facilities like table tennis and pool table are in horrible and almost unplayable condition. \n3. Pool water was dirty.\n4. Food was pathetic. This was not only our opinion but almost all present there had the same feeling. Although after complaining, food and the spread was better next day. \n5. T.V in one of the room was not working and after enquiring received an answer from room service that refill is not done. What is even more annoying is they didn\u2019t bother to resolve the issue during our stay.\n6. Door lock was not working in one of the rooms. Problem never got resolved even after complaining so many times.\n7. Room service was at a snail\u2019s pace. Even a glass of warm water could take 25 minutes to reach your room.\n\nWhat pissed us the most was the attitude of the staff. They seemed conveniently ignorant about all these things, and it was also evident that they are used to hear these complaints. Its only when we escalated our concerns to their Mumbai office to ask for a refund, a manager came to visit us in our room to hear us out. By then it was too late and we had spoiled our holidays.",1,negative

On checking in I was quite pleased with the ambience at the reception but my nightmare was about to begin . The room which aws supposed to be a Superor one lokked out to a garden where a corporate party was going on in full swing . Even shutting the windows did not help as the sound system kept on belching raunchy songs till almost midnight . In between I had to call Housekeeping twice to look at the AC and both times they tinkered with it and said it was fine . Finally at 2 am I gave up as the haet was unbearable - calls to Reception or HK yielded no results - so I had to walk down to find somebody sleeping in the lounge to inform him to change the room which he agreed after half an hour of bantering and after I had threatened to call up the owner . I found out in the morning that I had been transfered to a normal room and the difference was not payable . I was rudely told that I had spent half the night in a Superior Room so I was to pay for the same !

Excellent service,  very courteous staff,  decently maintained property, very clean rooms and loved it more because everything was very systematic and surprisingly fun too. We went in a group of 13 (including 2 kids under 6). A special thanks and applause for the lady in charge,  Mrs Megha Patel.  She made sure that everyone in our group had the best time. Well mannered staff and made sure that most of our reasonable requests were adhered to. Thank you so much. \n\nNow a little in depth : \n\n1.Rooms : Well maintained and clean. The room service is excellent and the linens were clean. \n\n2. Food : Well,  we were in a package so couldn't get a chance to try the Ala Carte food. But the buffet was good to go with. Being a non vegetarian,  I devoured on the single dish served with the buffet everyday. The fish was amazing and chicken was cooked properly. Vegetarian food must had been good because most of my family members didn't complain.\n\n3. Swimming pool : kids had a lot of fun. \nA very small pool but quite enjoyable. There is a kids pool too but my kids preferred to sit on my shoulders while in deep. The deep isn't more than 4.5 feet so nothing to worry about. The best part was the Bollywood music,  which was played when someone was in the pool. Cheesy I know but was fun. \n\n4. Kids play area and Games Section : boy o boy,,, this was the steal deal for my kids. They had a blast. Few video games,  air hockey and the \""pick up the teddy bear\""  from the lot were in demand. Especially the picking up the bear was easy so kids had super fun winning small teddy bears.\n\nAnd few swings and rides for kids were more than enough for kids to spend their time. \n\n5. Orchestra : Due to festival season,  they had a daily orchestra planned in the evenings. Live music and request for songs after few drinks is everyone's favourite. \n\n6. Parking : Ample parking space. The property is huge and trust me, it's well Managed. \n\n7. Fogging for mosquitoes : on the first evening, we were quite worried as the entire resort is huge and has lot of greenery. But to our utter delight, they had this little portable mosquito fogging machine which made sure that there were no mosquitoes when we were enjoying food outside. \n\nWe went without any high expectations and most of the things were in place as per our standard expectations. \n\nHaven't clicked any picture of the property. Have most of the picture with kids in it. So skipping it from the review. \n\nCheers. ",5,positive

May be it was the time of the year - Christmas\u002FNew year break. \n\nAnyway, the hotel is situated on Devka beach itself, with several other hotels near by.  Hotel is of a fair size with a massive outdoor restaurant at the back with a vast choice but a bit pricey. It has a  swimming pool and a steam room.  There is also an indoor restaurant on the first floor (Solmar) where the breakfast is served every morning for the residents.\n\nOur experience:\nThe old adage \""Too many cooks spoil the broth\"" seem to apply perfectly to the hotel. Too many chiefs and not enough workers! Had a couple of mishaps which left me reeling with anger when it came to service and taking ownership.\nThe first experience we had was on the day we arrived. Went to the restaurant in the afternoon for some snacks, ordered some water, and ordered it again, and again - 3 times and 25minutes later), the  water arrived only after I got angry at the waiter, who blamed the captain for not tearing a chit? The waiters would not bring anything unless he was given a chit by the captain!  - first time I put it down to a simple error.\n\nSecond day, we went for an evening meal. A busy evening as it was Christmas day. Ordered and had our meal, after which I ordered a cup of tea. It took 40 minutes before the tea arrived! straight away I requested the bill, as I was absolutely frustrated by the service. Waited 20minutes and the bill still hadn't arrived. We got up spoke to a person in a suit who looked like a manager and told him to put the bill on my room account and told him about what had happened.\n\nWe went to reception to collect our rooms keys and when asked by the receptionist about our evening we told him what had happened and he told me to speak to the General Manager and said he was in the restaurant and I should go and meet him. He took me to see him, and to my amazement it was the same person I had asked to put the bill on my room charges. He told me they were busy and apologized. Again I put the matter behind us.\n\nThe hotel had organised a New Year's bash and anyone staying at the hotel 30th and 31st were on a Compulsory package, which included B\u002FF, Lunch and Dinner. Since we had gone for a week, we were on this package, but no details were given to us.\n\nOn the 29th while working at reception (the only place where wi-fi is available in the hotel), I asked the receptionist what the package included and asked him for all the info he had. He told me he would get that to me in the room.\n\nOn the 30th morning while going for a walk, I was handed the coupons for two days for B\u002FF, Lunch and Dinner - no explanation, nothing in writing.\n\nAfter a long walk came into the hotel through the back from the beach and on passing the restaurant I asked one of the captains, as to why the restaurant was not busy and that I expected a buffet for the guests - his comments were \""no sir it is a-la-carte, why don't you come in and take a table?\"" After another five minutes we went to the restaurant, ordered some snacks as we were not really that hungry. On completion of the meal, I asked the waiter to bring the bill (as I knew we had to pay for the drinks). I handed the waiter the coupons only to be told that the coupons could not be used there and that guests on package had to go to Solmar restaurant. I then argued with the captain, as to why we were not informed when we asked before also that the receptionist had not mentioned this the previous day or had not supplied any info. This third mistake as unforgivable and I stood my ground. The captain called the GM and I explained to him that despite asking for the info I was not given any info or even when handing me the coupons, the receptionist had not mention this. A true GM would have resolved the situation there and then, BUT, not the case here. To prove his point he asked me to accompany him to the receptionist - and there he stood on one side while me and the receptionist talked about what happened and how. By this time I had lost my patience and told the receptionist to prepare my bill as I was checking out. The GM just literally walked away without a word. The receptions pleaded with us not to check out as it was their fault and give them another chance. If it wasn't for the receptionist I would have walked out of there. \n\nAnyway, the hotel had a live band playing every evening till 1.00 to 1.30am, so not much sleep. This happens every weekend from what the waiters told me.\nThe availability of the drinks and the music attracts a lot of visitors from the neighbouring state of Gujarat where the alcohol is banned. Most of these are single males in their 20's-30's.\nThey tend to come to Daman for booze, music and women (and before anyone says anything else - we had seen this ourselves and it is not on hear say).\n\t\nThe hotel does not employ any guards at the restaurant in the evening - which we felt is a necessity since we saw at least two drunkards dancing who were carrying guns. A worrying sign when there is free flowing booze and these guys carrying guns!.\nTalking about dancing, the dance floor was full of men dancing and not a single woman on the floor. In fact you wouldn't even think of taking a woman on the floor with these boozed up men behaving the way they were.\n\nOverall: \n  Good points: Good location, some very good staff who were willing to help. \n  Bad points: Restaurant a bit pricey, as they say one rotten apple destroys the whole apple cart and in this case the GM with his leadership destroys the name of this hotel. \n\nI would definitely say, this is not a hotel for families or couples with the rowdy behaviour of some of the clientele in the evening not something I would want my children to watch.",3,negative

Luckily my cousin was able to locate a hotel named SILVER SANDS in Daman for a mid-range price of Rs 3200 which was not cheap but definitely not too expensive. (STANDARD ROOM)\n\nFirst Impression: The hotel has a very shady entrance similar to a bus stop lodge. But we decided to ignore that and move on. The lane leading to the hotel has some dilapidated old buildings which again worried us a bit. \n\nThe real horror began when the attendant led us to our room. Words cannot describe what awaited us. \n\n1) Room was dimly lit with water seepage. It appeared that certain portions of the wall had fungus growing on it. \n2) Pillows were tattered and frayed and the curtains were torn. \n3) The view from the room was of the back area of the kitchen with disgusting garbage and bottles thrown around. \n4) The TV seemed to be 10-15 years old with only 10-15 channels actually working (mostly local channels)\n5) The bathroom was dirty. The water for some reason is oily and i constantly felt like i would fall sick if i used it. \n6) There were drunk people in the restaurant (hotel guests) and one of them vomited while we were seated near the pool area. The waiters and management saw all this but did not say anything since this was a big group (lots of money paid)\n7) The hotel management asked us to leave our car key with the guard. This seems like a shady request as the car was nicely parked. I have now seen reviews where cars have been damaged by staff so i can only imagine what would have happened.\n8) The hotel played loud music till 12:30- 1 AM in the night. (this is what all the guests want apparently)\n\nWe finally realized why the the booking was non-refundable. Anyone who takes a look at the room and pathetic facilities will want a refund instantly. \n\nWe hoped that the beach location opposite will be a saving grace. However it is littered with garbage, patrolled by stray dogs and full of men drinking (this was at 10 in the morning so i can imagine the evening situation)\n\nSYNOPSIS: If you are concerned with the health, safety and well being of your family and friends, kindly do not stay in this hotel. \n\nHEALTH AND SAFETY WARNING:If you have KIDS, i would recommend that you do not expose them to the unclean rooms, drunk and rowdy guests and strange water.",1,negative

All amenities worked well. Bathrooms were clean and decently maintained. Service was decent. Food was nice. Overall the look and feel was not very different than a serviced apartment or local hotel they use for hosting interview candidates and new hires in MNCs in places like Bangalore, Hyderabad, etc. (I didn't test WiFi much as I was on a break from work.)\n\nThe hotel is located alongside several others on a road that overlooks the beach. You won't get a view of the beach from many of the rooms of this hotel though! The beach is on the *other* side of the road. However, the hotel is at the far end from the main city area so it is also quieter as a bonus. The road itself is very nice and makes for a great walk in mornings and evenings (felt very safe too!).\n\nA few things about Daman:\nDaman is a quaint, quiet place with not a lot of buzz. (We were here on a week day so perhaps it gets more active on weekends.) \n\nThere are not a whole lot of spots to see...perhaps a couple of churches, the forts on either side of the water body and the waterpark. You can finish these in a day. \n\nThe beaches don't have good sand. But there are lots of shacks (kind of like Goa but just a bit low scale) that will serve you fresh cooked veg\u002Fnon-veg food and alcohol. I think the latter part is important as you are surrounded by a dry state. :-)\n \nHistory wise it was interesting to find out that Goa, Daman and Diu - which one might imagine were near each other - aren't exactly so. Even Daman and Diu are quite a ways from each other. Apparently, they got clubbed together into one Union Territory one fine day as they were liberated from Portuguese control by a coordinated operation of our armed forces on the same day in Dec 1961. Senior enough locals might tell you interesting stories about how many unfortunate deaths happened in the operation in Daman because the senior Portuguese command in Goa could not communicate the decision to surrender without much conflict early enough to Daman.\n\nOverall, both the hotel and Daman are good place to hang out and not do much of anything except hanging out. :-) :-)",4,positive

This hotel has breathtaking beach view from their Restaurant. The hotel is located exactly on the beach so you have direct access to the beach. The beach is not so clean but manageable and less crowded. \n\nRoom :- Their Rooms are big . Ample space to keep you bags. The room is well furnished with all necessary amenities and a cool wardrobe. Room was very clean and up to date. My room was on ground floor. The disadvantage was the view from the window of the room. My room window had some backyard view of hotel where every now and then some persons from the staff used to wait and talk loudly. There was no privacy. I could not even open the curtains of the window. Secondly the sound of the Bell of the room sounds horrifying. Please change it. It has some loud and horrible music which keeps playing for few seconds. I could not find any button to off the same. Lastly the adjacent rooms are so close to each other that you can hear what the persons from adjacent room are talking, you can also hear the the sound of Tv of the other room which is actually bad. Though Wi-fi is 24X7 in my room I could not get the range properly. Out of the room the wi-fi works fine.\n\nRestaurant :- Full marks to it. It has breathtaking view of the beach. The Restaurant has ample tables so even if it is crowed (On weekends) you will certainly find a place to sit. They have different types of table at different places so you actually have lot of choice as per your comfort. They also have wide space with artificial lawn where you can find 3\u002F4 swings where you can sit and relax. Lastly the Food quality was awesome. There is no scope to complaint about it.\n\nStaff :- The entire staff including the restaurant staff is very polite and co-operative. Whatever you demand it will be at your door next minute. My car was also washed by them before I left. \n\nIssues i experienced :- I checked in on Friday as such it was working day so the hotel was less crowded.   But on Saturday the hotel was full of drunkards. till 2 AM there was continuous noise and nuisance of people in the corridor. I failed to understand why the hotel staff did not ask them to keep mum.  On Saturday night my door was banged twice and when I open the door no one was there. The hotel should use their CCTV in reality. Thereafter at 1.15 AM at night one drunkard person again bang my door with the irritating bell. Fortunately the hotel staff was around who scold the person. Thereafter at night I could hear one person was continuously crying loudly from the adjacent room. Thereafter till 4.15 AM the same person kept Vomiting after every half an hour. I don't understand where the hell was the staff of the hotel. I am sure they could hear it too. Whatever may be the reason the hotel staff is bound to check what is going on in their hotel. I actually could not sleep whole night. I understand at the time of booking hotel is unknown about the types of persons coming for stay but as soon as they see any such thing immediate action is required. I felt like I am staying in some cheap lodge. That is the reason the rooms should have some space in between them.        \n\nOverall:- I would say if you are going on odd days then this is the Hotel you can enjoy. But on weekends beware from Drunkards. One of my 2 nights was nightmare. I would say spend some additional money you get 3\u002F4 star hotels in the same vicinity. The hotel is not bad but then you need some privacy which was the major draw back of my trip.",3,negative

data\ca\297600\1400657\336122328.html,Mirasol Resort,"""We generally try to go to out-of-the way places for our holidays, for obvious and various reasons. Auli (Uttarkhand), Gangtok(Sikkim) are recent examples. Hence the choice of Daman. Daman is quite a polluted city owing to numerous chemical and plastic industries, and the sea itself is so polluted, the fish are just not available unless the fishermen venture far out. Yet it is an attractive location for mostly people from Gujarat ( under prohibition) and Mumbai, owing to the plentiful supply of alcohol in every nook and cranny. The beaches are quaint and quite crowded in the holiday season though very few people actually venture to take a bath for reason stated above. There are pebbled and rocky beaches and gravel beaches and sandy ones all dark brown colored. One interesting feature is the daily high and low tides exposing the rocky coastline for a couple of kilometers out everyday and then covering them up again . We enjoyed a parasailing trip on the Jampore beach which , though expensive was worth it. The beaches are taken over by restaurents in shanties that serve alcohol and all sorts of food, which though not very hyegenic, is tasry and not too expensive. But i think they should not have been permitted to invade the beaches.  There are two forts in Nani(small) and Moti (Big ) Daman built by the Portugese, and a few churches and temples.  The town is quite small with hardly anything to see. (in fact, with five days to spend at Daman, we wre at a loss as to HOW to spend them, and took an impulsive dash to Shirdi some 250 km away, which was a relief, but a different story).The siesta like lazy air prevails for half of the day. The resort itself is some way outside the city, well located,and with a waterpark attached. They boast of a swimming pool but its just a two-feet wading pool and located something like a public fountain where no privacy or peace. The water park charges some Rs 700 for entry (with 10% discount for resort guests), but we didnt try it since the rides were rather ordinary, having seen much better ones in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. During holidays the daytime waterpark and booze crowd drown out all possibilities of a peaceful sojourn. They also mix with the  resort guests and its rather noisy and crowded. The food is excellent, and booze cheap (though food is not). . The rooms DO not have coffee machine or accessories and there are no restaurants near the resort so you are at their mercy unless you want to drive out 3-4 km for every meal. Though rooms are clean and well maintained, the non provision of a bucket or mug in the toilet was a problem.To top it all there was this big fat  wedding of some rich business families which eliminated any possibilities of peace and quiet for three days with their wet-parties, dinners, loud music, dancing , baraat , band etc!!. No in-room wifi. Only avble in the lobby.. On the whole it was not exactly a restful experience, though not without some pluses.",3,negative

We checked for food especially non veg.
